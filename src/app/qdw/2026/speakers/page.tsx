    bio: 'Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamentally a challenge of hardware latency and massive data throughput. As physical qubit counts scale, the sheer volume of continuous syndrome data creates a severe I/O and processing bottleneck. For device designers, the time budget to measure an ancilla qubit, digitize the signal, decode the logical error, and fire a corrective microwave or flux pulse is unforgiving—often strictly bounded under a single microsecond. If the control and decoding architectures cannot keep pace, errors accumulate faster than they can be suppressed, nullifying the fault-tolerance threshold. This talk details the recent integration of Qblox’s scalable quantum control electronics with Riverlane’s hardware-accelerated Deltaflow QEC decoders, and examines how this fast-feedback architecture can inform next-generation quantum device design. We will unpack the physical implementation of the Quantum Error Correction interface (QECi)—the ultra-low-latency data link connecting Qblox’s deterministic SYNQ and LINK network (capable of distributing measurement outcomes across modules in ~400 ns) directly into Riverlane’s FPGA-based Local Clustering Decoder (LCD). Crucially, we will explore how offloading decoding to a specialized real-time hardware layer fundamentally alters the constraints placed on the QPU itself.',

Using interactive Jupyter notebooks, we will walk through the 3D geometry construction of the semiconductor device and the subsequent calculation of its electrostatic potentials and quantum mechanical eigenstates by using QTCAD®’s Poisson and Schrödinger solvers. Furthermore, the demonstration will showcase resonator design by utilizing the Quantum Metal framework for layout generation alongside QTCAD®\'s Maxwell solver for eigenmode extraction.
